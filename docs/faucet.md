# Get free $KIW from the faucet

To help new users onboard quickly, Wakweli provides a free 60 $KIW faucet directly on the Base network. This faucet is accessible from the [main interface](https://canary.wakweli.com/){:target="_blank"} when you have a balance of 0 $KIW in your wallet.

And if you use to the [Base Account smart wallet](baseaccount.md), so you can start using the protocol immediately: no seed phrase, no gas fees, no external funding.

What you get:

* 60 $KIW credited to your wallet (gas sponsored if you use the [Base Account smart wallet](baseaccount.md))
* Enough to request, review, and challenge certificates on the Canary Mainnet.
* Refills are not automatic: the faucet is a one-time grant per user to kickstart your journey.
