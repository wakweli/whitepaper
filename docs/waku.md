- Pre-Token: $KIWAKU
- Blockchain: Ethereum
- Initial supply: 1 000 000 000

$WAKU is essential to the protocol's operations, forming the foundation of the PoD. Ownership of $WAKU is necessary for participation, and contributors are rewarded with $WAKU for fostering trust and collaboration.

In addition, $WAKU will be used to vote on proposals governing the Wakweli Foundation.

## Business Model

**Revenue Sharing**: The protocol operates sustainably by taking 3% of the staked amount for each generated certificate. Once a certificate is created, rewards are distributed to contributors â€” 70% to Certifiers and 30% to Electors. From these rewards, 3% is directed back to the Wakweli treasury, ensuring long-term growth, development, and the continuous improvement of the protocol.
