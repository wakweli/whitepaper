## Business Model

**Revenue Sharing**: The protocol operates sustainably by taking 3% of the staked amount for each generated certificate. Once a certificate is created, rewards are distributed to contributors â€” 70% to Certifiers and 30% to Electors. From these rewards, 3% is directed back to the Wakweli treasury, ensuring long-term growth, development, and the continuous improvement of the protocol.
