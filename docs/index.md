# Project Overview

Wakweli is a decentralized protocol designed to restore trust in the digital ecosystem by verifying and certifying the authenticity of digital information.

Leveraging its innovative **Proof-of-Democracy (PoD)** consensus mechanism, Wakweli enables a collaborative, community-driven approach to certifying assets such as NFTs, social media profiles, and other digital data.

This protocol empowers participants—including requesters, certifiers, electors, and challengers—to work collectively, ensuring transparency and rewarding them with **$WAKU tokens** for their contributions.

The protocol operates on a scalable **EVM Layer-2 blockchain (Base)**, supported by **Ethereum** for token supply, ensuring high performance, efficiency, and decentralization.

Verification is made seamless through the [**Wakweli Chrome Extension**](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/wakweli/bhlmfakmgikajjenjhafifmdkkjchcli), which provides real-time certification statuses for NFTs and social media accounts, helping users identify legitimate assets and profiles with ease.

Wakweli operates sustainably through a **revenue-sharing model**, allocating 3% of staked amounts from each certificate to its treasury for continued development. Following the successful completion of three Alpha phases—validating NFT authenticity on OpenSea and certifying social media profiles on platforms like X (formerly Twitter)—Wakweli has demonstrated its ability to bring trust and transparency to the digital world.

With a mission to create a safer, fraud-free digital environment, Wakweli combines cutting-edge blockchain technology, token-based incentives, and community collaboration to authenticate digital information. Guided by its core values of authenticity, integrity, and transparency, Wakweli is building the foundation for a trusted global digital economy.
