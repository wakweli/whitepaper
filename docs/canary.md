# What is the Canary Mainnet?

The Wakweli Canary Mainnet is the first live deployment of the Wakweli certification protocol on the Base blockchain. It serves as a transitional environment between the testnet and the final mainnet launch. While it operates under real mainnet conditions, it uses the pre-token, $KIWAKU (KIW) instead of the future final utility token $WAKU.

## Purpose

The Canary Mainnet is designed to:

* Spot bugs: Identify potential issues in a live setting.
* Fix edge cases: Correct unexpected behaviors before scaling.
* Fine-tune protocol parameters: Adjust mechanisms to ensure stability and fairness.

This makes it the final proving ground for the protocol before the official Token Generation Event (TGE) and launch of the $WAKU-powered mainnet.

## Why “Canary”?

The name comes from a mining practice. Miners used canary birds underground to detect toxic gases: if the bird stopped singing, danger was near. Likewise, the Canary Mainnet acts as an early-warning system for protocol stability, signaling potential risks before full-scale deployment.

The same analogy applies in the Blockchain world in the Polkadot space, where the Kusama blockchain is the Canary Network of Polkadot: same mainnet conditions, different environment to allow for further experimentations.

## Key Characteristics

* Real Mainnet Environment: All interactions occur on Base under real blockchain conditions.
* Pre-Token usage ($KIWAKU): allows for experimentation and onboarding before releasing the main $WAKU token.
* Community Access: Early users can bridge $KIW from Ethereum or request tokens via the faucet or Wakweli’s Discord to participate freely.
* Feedback-Driven: Issues, bugs, and improvements reported by the community directly shape the final protocol.

## Access and Participation

Users from the Alpha phase on Ethereum can [bridge their existing $KIW to Base](bridge.md).

New participants can obtain [free KIW using the faucet](faucet.md) on the mainnet interface, or by opening a support ticket on Wakweli’s Discord server.

Tutorials and guides are available on Discord to help with bridging and exploring the protocol.

## Roadmap Position

The Canary Mainnet marks the last stage before launch. It validates the system under live conditions, paving the way to:

* Full $WAKU Mainnet launch
* Token Generation Event (TGE)
* Scalable certification network on Base

## I have $KIW on Eth from the Private Sale / Akpha Tests / Giveaways, do I need to bridge my Ethereum $KIW to Base?

You don't *need* to bridge your $KIW to Base, but you will need them if you want to use the Canary Mainnet.
There will be some rewards for all Canary Mainnet participants before the final launch, so we advise anyone to have a look at the Canary and experiment with its live features.
