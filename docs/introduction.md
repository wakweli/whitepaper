# Introduction

## Wakweli, in Swahili, means the “truthful” or “truthsayers”

As more aspects of our lives move online, fraud and scams are becoming increasingly common, targeting everything from digital assets and AI-generated content to online payments and personal identities. **Wakweli** was born to restore confidence in the digital ecosystem by creating a protocol that verifies and certifies the digital information.

At its core, Wakweli is a **community-powered protocol** that enables anyone to confirm the authenticity of digital information through a decentralized certification process. Whether it’s a social media profile, a news story, or a website, Wakweli ensures that the information we rely on is trustworthy and accurate.

By empowering individuals to request and validate certificates, Wakweli builds a **collaborative ecosystem** where **truth thrives**. Participants—electors, requesters, certifiers, and challengers—are rewarded for their role in maintaining honesty and fairness, creating a system built on collective responsibility and trust.
