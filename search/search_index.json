Initially incubated by EverdreamSoft (EDS) until the creation of its dedicated foundation in September 2024, Wakweli has evolved into a powerful protocol for verifying and certifying digital information.</p> <p>EverdreamSoft, a Swiss-based pioneer in blockchain innovation, is best known for creating Spells of Genesis (SoG), the first blockchain-based mobile game launched in 2015. By Q1 2022, SoG cards had reached a market capitalization exceeding $400 million. However, the rise in popularity also brought challenges, including the proliferation of scams targeting these valuable assets. Wakweli emerged as a solution\u2014not only to safeguard Spells of Genesis assets but to protect all NFT projects and consumers across the growing digital ecosystem.</p> <p>Since the establishment of its foundation in September 2024, Wakweli has pivoted from focusing solely on NFTs and tokenized assets to addressing the broader challenge of verifying all forms of digital information. Its first use case following this shift was the verification of X (formerly Twitter) social media profiles, showcasing the protocol's ability to bring trust and transparency to online interactions. By expanding its scope, Wakweli aims to reach a wider audience and establish trust across the entire digital landscape, creating a safer, more reliable online environment.</p>"},{"location":"about/#our-mission","title":"Our Mission","text":"<p>We aim to create a safer digital world by empowering communities to verify the authenticity of digital information.
